Hi, I'm Vitor Stone, a 4th year Electrical Engineering Student from Brazil 🇧🇷 , living in Canada 🇨🇦 . I'm a very dedicated guy towards anything I want to commit. Sharing knowledge and exchanging experiences is also something I like a lot, specially within the developer community, where people are very united. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Apartsy, a Montreal-based proptech startup that I cofounded along with 2 other friends. Apartsy is a rental marketplace mobile application that offers a fully digital experience between landlords and tenants. 
- 🌱 I’m continuously learning Javascript, React and React Native.
- 👯 I would be happy to collaborate with anything someone might need help with. I love sharing ideas and helping people out.
- 💬 You can also ask me anything, Math, Physics, Programming, Electrical Engineering, etc. I'd be glad to help!
- 📫 How to reach me: vitor.oliveira@ontariotechu.net or through my WhatsApp. 

- ⚡ Fun fact: I can solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded.
